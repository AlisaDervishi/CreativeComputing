# Creative Computing

## What is Creative Computing?
Creative Computing is the combination of creative arts crossed with computing and technology, it is a way to merge the two together producing a whole new world to computing and code altogether.
> Many different factors that go into creative computing include;
> 
>> 1. Technology
>> 2. Physical Computing
>> 3. Open-source

## Technology
<p>The development of smartphones has evolved so fast over the past few years.<br>
Social media plays a massive part in our daily lives, it is so easy to get caught up in peoples virtual lives and how everyone represents themselves.
  
Artificial intelligence and Extended reality also play a large role in the basics of what Creative Computing is.
  These are various types of immersive learning technologies. These technologies interchange reality, making training more engaging and effective, this is done by adding a simulation of the real world through digital materils to create this **Extended Reality**.
  
<h2>Physical Computing
</h2>
Physical Computing is when a computer interacts with the world around it, the computer processes it's environment and responds to that through action. 
<p>An example of Physical Computing through data visualisation is an experimental project called 'Lian' by Jann Choy.<br>
<p>Choy designed a mask that combined the relationship between the persona that we portray online and our real selves that is offline. The mask changes when you express a fake emotion online, it inflates and deflates depending in what emotion you are depicting, this means that whatever emotion you portray, the mask will reveal it in real life.<br>
It was created through AI, so that if the emotion is positive the area of the mask that gives a positive response will inflate, however if a negative emotion is being indicated, then the opposite area will start to inflate instead.<br>
The masks shape and design is inspired by the Chinese dramatic art of face changing.

<h2>Open-source
</h2>
<p>Lastly Open-source is also a sharing factor in the build up of Creative Computing.<br>
Open-source is a computer software. This software is a way for holders to let users develop, edit or change a part of the software in a collaborative manner making it an open collaboration. 
  
<h1>Reflection
  </h1>
  Creative Computing is so broad and is evolving everyday. I have learnt that this topic doesn't only have to focus on technology and computer but can also involve design and art in many different ways. I still haven't learned everything I could about code in just a week but I would love to explore more and dig even deeper into the Creative Computing community even more.
